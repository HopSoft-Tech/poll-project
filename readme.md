## Basic Poll Project

### Overview

This project is a simple poll application that allows users to vote for their favorite JavaScript framework from a selection of options. It was built on the knowledge of the use of Maps in JavaScript to efficiently manage and track poll results. The results are displayed in real-time after submission. The application is built with HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for styling.

### Features

- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is styled using Bootstrap, ensuring it looks good on all devices.
